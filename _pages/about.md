I am a PhD student in the [SOLA](https://www.software-lab.org/index.html) at the [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en) and the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/), Germany, advised by [Prof. Michael Pradel](https://software-lab.org/people/Michael_Pradel.html).
My research interests focus on improving the quality and efficiency of software. Previously, my research mainly focused on automatic program bug repair. Recently, I started working on program analysis. I am always happy with opportunities to expand my research directions.

I received my Mater's degree in the University of Seoul, South Korea, and I received my Bachelor's degree in Xinzhou Teachers University, China.
